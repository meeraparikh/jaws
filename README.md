# JAWS
### JAWS is a high school dragonboating team based in Long Beach, CA. Dragonboat racing is a team sport comprised of up to 20 paddlers with one steersman and one caller. Paddlers aim to beat other boats in a competitive race anywhere from 250m to 2,000m. Technique, rhythm, and synchrony allow the boat to surge and take first place.

Just after the San Diego Dragonboat Race concludes, the boats are lined up on shore. Volunteers clean and drain away the day's paddling.
